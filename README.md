# weather-nowcasting
This repository is what I produced for a technical test on weather forecasting, the main goal was to implement and train both a simple persistence baseline model (i.e., the forecast for
time t+1 is simply the image at time t) and a more advanced deep learning model (e.g., ConvLSTM or U-Net) for the nowcasting task. Here for reason described in the`02_models.ipynb` I choose to implement a Unet for the second one.
